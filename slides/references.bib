abstract = {''Neighborhood approaches'' have been used in two primary ways to postprocess and verify high-resolution ensemble output. While the two methods appear deceptively similar, they define events over different spatial scales and yield fields with different interpretations: the first produces probabilities interpreted as likelihood of event occurrence at the grid scale, while the second produces probabilities of event occurrence over spatial scales larger than the grid scale. Unfortunately, some studies have confused the two methods, while others did not acknowledge multiple possibilities of neighborhood approach application and simply stated, ''a neighborhood approach was applied'' without supporting details. Thus, this paper reviews applications of neighborhood ap-proaches to convection-allowing ensembles in hopes of clarifying the two methods and their different event definitions. Then, using real data, it is demonstrated how the two approaches can yield statistically significantly different objective conclusions about model performance, underscoring the critical need for thorough descriptions of how neighborhood approaches are implemented and events are defined. The authors conclude by providing some recommendations for application of neighborhood approaches to convection-allowing ensembles.},

abstract = {AbstractWhile traditional verification methods are commonly used to assess numerical model quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) using a grid-to-grid approach, they generally offer little diagnostic information or reasoning behind the computed statistic. On the other hand, advanced spatial verification techniques, such as neighborhood and object-based methods, can provide more meaningful insight into differences between forecast and observed features in terms of skill with spatial scale, coverage area, displacement, orientation, and intensity. To demonstrate the utility of applying advanced verification techniques to mid- and coarse-resolution models, the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) applied several traditional metrics and spatial verification techniques to QPFs provided by the Global Forecast System (GFS) and operational North American Mesoscale Model (NAM). Along with frequency bias and Gilbert skill score (GSS) adjusted for bias, both the fractions skill score (FSS) and Method for Object-Ba...},

abstract = {A recently developed method of defining rain areas for the purpose$\backslash$nof verifying precipitation produced by numerical weather prediction$\backslash$nmodels is described. Precipitation objects are defined in both forecasts$\backslash$nand observations based on a convolution (smoothing) and thresholding$\backslash$nprocedure. In an application of the new verification approach, the$\backslash$nforecasts produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)$\backslash$nmodel are evaluated on a 22-km grid covering the continental United$\backslash$nStates during July-August 2001. Observed rainfall is derived from$\backslash$nthe stage-IV product from NCEP on a 4-km grid (averaged to a 22-km$\backslash$ngrid). It is found that the WRF produces too many large rain areas,$\backslash$nand the spatial and temporal distribution of the rain areas reveals$\backslash$nregional underestimates of the diurnal cycle in rain-area occurrence$\backslash$nfrequency. Objects in the two datasets are then matched according$\backslash$nto the separation distance of their centroids. Overall, WRF rain$\backslash$nerrors exhibit no large biases in location, but do suffer from a$\backslash$npositive size bias that maximizes during the later afternoon. This$\backslash$ncoincides with an excessive narrowing of the rainfall intensity range,$\backslash$nconsistent with the dominance of parameterized convection. Finally,$\backslash$nmatching ability has a strong dependence on object size and is interpreted$\backslash$nas the influence of relatively predictable synoptic-scale systems$\backslash$non the larger areas.},
