In this repository you will find the slides and notebooks for my presentation on Ensemble
Visualization and Verification in Python. To get started, download this repository as a
 .zip by choosing `Clone or download -> Download Zip`. After downloading the repository,
 download the sample data
 [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11I31FX3cZNZ12dTRG-4g4r6ZReywdE2k).
 Extract this file within the `workshop2018` folder. Finally, install the
[Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) python distribution and create the workshop
environment by navigating to the `workshop2018` folder in a terminal and typing
`conda env create`. Launch the sample notebooks by typing `source activate workshop`
and then `jupyter lab`.
